## Web Filtering

Web Filtering allows you to control and manage which websites a specific group can access. Here's how to configure it:

1. **Select a Group**: Begin by choosing the group for which you want to set filtering rules.

2. **Block Categories**: Identify and block specific categories to prevent the selected group from accessing them.

3. **Manage Websites**:
   - **Blocklist & Allowlist**: Add specific websites to a blocklist to prevent access or to an allowlist to ensure access. 
   - **Remove Websites**: To remove a website from either list, click on the garbage bin icon next to the website name.

4. **Time-based Rules**: If you wish to restrict access based on specific times, press the clock icon to set a time slot.

5. **Activate Changes**: After making your desired configurations, ensure you click the `Submit Rules` button to update and apply the rules.
