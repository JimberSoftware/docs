## Configuring Web Filtering

To configure web filtering, follow the steps below:

1. **Select a Group**: Begin by choosing the group for which you want to set filtering rules.

2. **Block categories**: Identify and block specific categories to prevent the selected group from accessing them. Hit the corresponding slider.

3. **Manage Websites**:
   - **Blocklist**: Add specific websites to the blocklist to prevent access
   - **Allowlist**: Add specific websites to the allowlist to ensure access. 
   - **Remove Websites**: To remove a website from either list, click on the red trash bin icon next to the website name![recycle_bin.png](/icon_delete.png ':size=35').

4. **Time-based Rules**: If you wish to restrict access based on specific times, press the clock icon to set a time slot.

5. **Activate Changes**: After making your desired configurations, ensure you click the `Submit Rules` button ![submit_rules.png](/submit_rules.png ':size=100') to update and apply the rules.
