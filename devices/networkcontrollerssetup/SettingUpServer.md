Installation of the Network Controller Server

In [signal.jimber.io] signal.jimber.io go to Downloads to download the latest version of the networkcontroller.
The downloaded file can be used to install the Ubuntu-server. 
In the next window, click on Enter.

Then you will see a screen with the message “Confirm destructive action”. This is a warning that all data on the used disks will be lost. Only in case of starting this process by mistake, you can choose here for “Continue”.

The installation process will then begin and can take several minutes.

While Network Isolation is installed,  you can create your Network Controller on https://signal.jimber.io.  You can find more explanation on how to do so at https://docs.jimber.io/#/./devices/networkcontrollers/networkcontrollers 
Data you need:
•	Your Public IP. Use https://whatismyipaddress.com/ if necessary. 
•	Token: copy it!
•	Endpoint Address: see next step.
After installation is complete, reboot the system.
You need this data to proceed with the installation:
•	jimbernc login
•	The associated password
Now, you get the message “Welcome to Jimber NC”.


Choose the second option: “Configure Network Controller”. Enter the name of your company. Attention, this data is case-sensitive. Then, you have to fill in your Network Controller token you had to copy in a previous stage and hit Enter.
In the next screen you can also hit Enter. 

Check your WAN IP address. It should be correct!
