# User Devices

The "User Devices" section in our security platform provides an overview and management interface for devices associated with your users. Devices can range across various operating systems including Windows, Mac, and Linux.

### When are devices visible?

Devices will appear in the "User Devices" list as soon as:

1. The client software corresponding to the device's OS is successfully installed.
2. The user logs in for the first time from the device.

> [!INFO]
> If a device doesn't appear as expected after installation, ensure the device has an active internet connection, the user has logged in successfully, and consider restarting the client or the device.

## Desktop Client installation
Open the page signal.jimber.io and download the client that matches your operating system from the `Downloads` section:
