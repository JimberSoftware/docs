## Server installation

### Platforms 

<!-- tabs:start -->



#### **Windows**
Download the latest version for the 'Windows Server' from https://signal.jimber.io/downloads (no need to login).


Once downloaded, decompress the file and initiate the .msi installation file by double-clicking it.

A dialog box will emergeâ€”confirm the process by selecting 'Yes.'

Subsequently, open the file **`settings.json`** located at C:\Program Files\Jimber\ as an **Administrator**. 
In this file, enter the token you were provided upon creating the server within the Network Isolation interface. 
 
  

```json
{
 "publicKey": "l7D1+dm...",
 "privateKey": "ENjN41TJE7WEU76T...",
 "token": "YOUR_TOKEN"
}
```

> [!WARNING] 
**Attention!** Don't forget the comma at the end of lines and the quotation marks!
Ensure to save the changes made to the file.




The required token can be retrieved from the 'Servers' tab within the Signal server interface. Simply select and edit an existing server to find it.

Upon successful restart, the server should display a connected status (indicated by a green dot) in the Network Isolation interface. For any necessary troubleshooting, consult the log file at this location: 
`C:\Program Files\Jimber\jimbernetworkisolation.log`

Download the latest version for the 'Linux Server' from https://signal.jimber.io/downloads (no need to login).

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install wireguard
wget https://signal.jimber.io/clients/linux-server-latest.deb
sudo dpkg -i linux-server-latest.deb
```

Upon completion of the installation, a new `settings.json` file will be automatically created in the `/etc/jimber/`directory.
Open this file using the text editor of your choice. Within this file, you'll notice an empty token along with newly created public and private keys.

In this file, enter the token you were provided upon creating the server within the Network Isolation interface.

The required token can be retrieved from the 'Servers' tab within the Signal server interface. Simply select and edit an existing server to find it.

Restart the service by executing the following command:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart jimbernetworkisolation.service
