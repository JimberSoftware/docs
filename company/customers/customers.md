# Customers
> [!WARNING]
> This *`Customers`* section is exclusively available for **partners**. If you are an end customer, you will be directly redirected to the Network Isolation configuration of your company.

In our platform, a **customer** refers to a company intending to use Network Isolation. Integrators have the capability to manage these customers, ensuring seamless operations and service delivery.

For clarity, consider a scenario where a company named *`Astral Voyage`* wants to use Network Isolation. You must first create *`Astral Voyage`* as a customer on the platform before any further configurations or service provisions can occur.

## Create customer

To incorporate a new customer into the platform, click on the `Create new` button

You get an overview of created assets:
