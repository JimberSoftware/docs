# Customers
> [!WARNING]
> This *`Customers`* section is exclusively available for **integrators**. If you are an end customer, you will be directly redirected to the Network Isolation configuration of your company.

In our platform, a **customer** refers to a company intending to use Network Isolation. Integrators have the capability to manage these customers, ensuring seamless operations and service delivery.

For clarity, consider a scenario where a company named *`Astral Voyage`* wants to use Network Isolation. You must first create *`Astral Voyage`* as a customer on the platform before any further configurations or service provisions can occur.

## Create customer

To incorporate a new customer into the platform, click on the `Create new` button

## Edit customer
Customers can be edited by clicking on the yellow pencil icon next to their name ![pencil_2.png](/pencil_2.png).

> Changing the integrator will remove all current integrator roles.

## Delete customer

Customers can be deleted by clicking on the red trash bin icon next to their name ![recycle_bin.png](/recycle_bin.png).
